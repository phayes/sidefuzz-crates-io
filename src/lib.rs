//! SideFuzz is an adaptive fuzzer that uses a genetic-algorithim optimizer in combination with t-statistics to find side-channel (timing) vulnerabilities in cryptography compiled to wasm.
//!
//! See the [README](https://github.com/phayes/sidefuzz) for complete documentation.
//!
//! Creating a target in rust is done in the following way:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // lib.rs
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn fuzz() {
//!   let input = sidefuzz::fetch_input(32); // 32 bytes of of fuzzing input as a &[u8]
//!   sidefuzz::black_box(my_hopefully_constant_fn(input));
//! }
//! ```
//! ```toml
//! # Cargo.toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["cdylib"]
//!
//! [dependencies]
//! sidefuzz = "0.1.2"
//! ```
//! Compile and fuzz the target like so:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown                # Always build in release mode
//! sidefuzz fuzz ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_target.wasm # Fuzzing!
//! ```

/// A function that is opaque to the optimizer, to allow fuzzed functions to
/// pretend to use outputs to assist in avoiding dead-code elimination.
///
/// NOTE: We don't have a proper black box in stable Rust. This is
/// a workaround implementation, that may have a too big performance overhead,
/// depending on operation, or it may fail to properly avoid having code
/// optimized out. It is good enough that it is used.

    }

static mut INPUT_LEN: i32 = 0;

/// Get an input of the desired length.
/// This function should be called with a constant unchanging len argument.
/// Calling it with different lengths will result in invalid fuzzing.

/// ```ignore

/// sidefuzz::black_box(my_contant_time_fn(input));

// This is a VERY odd fuction that provides us with a really nice external API.
// 1. It is called once before fuzzing starts in order to set the size of INPUT.
// 2. After it is called once, we call input_pointer and input_len from the host to get a stable pointer to INPUT.
// 3. Fuzzing starts, we write data to INPUT from the host, then call the exported `fuzz` function.
